                                If you see a Bonton.com charge on your credit card statement that you or a joint account holder or other authorized user on your account did not authorize, report those charges to your issuing bank as quickly as possible. Oftentimes, such charges result from a stolen credit card or a compromised card number, and reporting the issue to your bank is the fastest and safest route to resolve. As a reminder and before reporting the charges make sure they weren’t made by a <b>joint account holder</b> or <b>other authorized user</b> on your account.

                                <p>We use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the industry standard for Internet Commerce transaction security, to encrypt your credit card and personal information as it travels over the Internet to us. In addition, we employ an outside third party company to ensure all credit card information is tokenized hence properly safeguarded. As a result you can shop with confidence.</p>
                                <p>Occasionally, your credit card issuer may determine that unauthorized charges are made on your credit card as a result of purchases made on our website, in such a case we will reimburse you up to $50 of any amount you are required to pay by the card issuer. Under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA), Federal law limits your responsibility for unauthorized charges to $50; and hence, we will cover you for this liability. In the event of an unauthorized use of your credit card, you should notify the card issuer in writing as soon as possible.</p>
