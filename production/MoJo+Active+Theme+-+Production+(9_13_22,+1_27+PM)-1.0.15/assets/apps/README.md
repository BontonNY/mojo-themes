# Frontend Applications in React

## Instructions

1. Create a `.entry.jsx` file in the `/assets/apps/` folder or subfolder(s).
2. Create the react render method in the entry file. You can use the following as templates:
   1. Example application found in `/assets/apps/hello-world/hello-world.entry.jsx`.
   2. VSCode snippet called `entry`.

You *will* need to restart stencil every time you create a new entry file. The new application will be bundle into the apps webpack bundle.
